  "There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard.",
  "Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface temperature of around 450Â° C. Did you know that Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun?  That is Mercury.  You would think that Mercury would then be the hottest, but Mercury has no atmosphere (which regulates temperature), resulting in big fluctuations.",
  "There are about three trillion trees on Planet Earth, and between 100-400 billion stars, approximately, in the galaxy.",
  "The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times that of Earth. Did you know that the Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen (three quarters worth) with the rest of its mass attributed to helium.  If the Sun had a voice would it be high and squeaky from all that helium?",
  "The Sun is large enough that approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit inside (if squashed in) or if the Earths retained their spherical shape then 960,000 would fit. But can you visualise that number of Earths?",
  "Venus has a slow axis rotation which takes 243 Earth days to complete its day. The orbit of Venus around the Sun is 225 Earth days, making a year on Venus 18 days less than a day on Venus."
